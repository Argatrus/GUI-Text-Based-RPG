This is the Developer Log for my Gui and Text Based RPG. 


Day 1: 
I coded a simple class for the Parent. Just a simple init and a set of methods for levelling up and headling.

Day 2:
Created a system for healing which relies on the number of heals basically skipping the player's turn if no heals are present. However, the enemy can still do whatever they choose to do.
I also created a global attacking system for all attacks with the name of the attack as a parameter making my life easier during the main code.

Day 3:
Created a enemy class which works with inheritance to the parent class.
Created a heal class which returns a iterator which can be converted to a list for the enemy and player classes. 
Realised i didnt implement accuracy system.

Day 4:
Started first steps for accuracy.

Day 5:
Added rename functionality for the characters.
